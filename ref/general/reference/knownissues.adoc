= Known issues

Be aware of the following issues that can cause problems for your instance of Kabanero.

== 

There is a compatibility issue with the Appsody CLI versions 0.5.5 and 0.5.6 that can cause build pipelines to fail. These versions of the Appsody CLI append the image registry to the application configuration in the image tag. This metadata format can conflict with the format that is used in the Kabanero instance. If the applications image is active in the Kabanero instance, the pipeline continues, otherwise the build fails.

After initializing the application, you can manually edit the `.appsody-config.yaml` file in the application source folder to remove the docker registry portion of the value of the image tag. Alternatively, use a different version of the Appsody CLI.
