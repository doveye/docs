= Configuring a Kabanero CR instance

A `Kabanero` custom resource (CR) instance describes a particular Kabanero
installation.  This description includes the locations of the Kabanero
Collections, and how the Kabanero CLI should interact with GitHub.

The `Spec` section of the `Kabanero` instance describes the desired
configuration.  The `Status` section is populated by the Kabanero operator,
and shows the versions of the components that make up Kabanero.  In some
cases, the `Status` also contains URLs that can be used to interact with
the components of Kabanero.

== Syntax

A `Kabanero` CR can be comprised of only a few attributes.
See the link:#examples[examples].  To define a `Kabanero` instance, you can
specify the following fields:

* `Spec`
** `version` - The release of Kabanero that you want to install.
   The levels of the individual components, such as the Appsody operator
   and CLI services, are selected automatically based on this level.  The
   release follows semver notation (for example, 0.2.0).
** `targetNamespaces` - A list of namespaces which the Appsody operator will
   watch for `AppsodyApplication` instances, in addition to the namespace
   where the Kabanero CR instance is deployed.  Typically an
   `AppsodyApplication` instance is created from the `app-deploy.yaml` file
   in an application, at the end of a deploy pipeline run.
** `github`
*** `organization` - The name of the GitHub organization where the collection
    repositories have been cloned.  The GitHub teams that administer the
    collections are also contained in this organization.
*** `teams` - A yaml list of GitHub teams that will be allowed to
    use the Kabanero CLI to administer the collection repositories.  All users
    who want to use the Kabanero CLI to administer the collections must be a
    member of a team in this list. To learn how to create teams in GitHub, see link:https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/creating-a-team[Creating a team, window=_blank].
*** `apiUrl` - The GitHub API URL for the GitHub containing the collection
    repositories.  For example, the API URL for github.com is https://api.github.com.
** `collections`
*** `repositories` - A list of repositories containing Kabanero collections.
**** `name` - A descriptive name of the collection repository.
**** `url` - The URL pointing to the collection repository.  For example, the
     default collection repository for Kabanero version 0.1.2 is
     https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/v0.1.2/kabanero-index.yaml
**** `activateDefaultCollections` - Controls whether the collections in the
     repository will be automatically activated by the Kabanero controller.
     Valid values are `true` and `false`.
**** `skipCertVerification` - Controls whether the Kabanero controller will
     validate SSL/TLS certificates presented by the repository URL.
     Valid values are `true` and `false`.
** `appsodyOperator`
*** `enable` - Controls whether the Kabanero operator will configure the
    Appsody operator to watch the namespace where the Kabanero operator is
    installed, as well as any additional namespaces specified in the
    `Spec.targetNamespaces` attribute.  Valid values are `true` and `false`.
    The default value is `true`.   Please see link:https://github.com/appsody/appsody-operator/blob/master/doc/user-guide.md[the Appsody operator user guide, window=_blank]
    for more information.
** `cliServices`
*** `sessionExpirationSeconds` - The length of time (duration) that
    a session established by a Kabanero CLI login remains valid.  The duration
    can be specified in hours, minutes and/or seconds.  For example,
    specifying a value of `3h30m30s` would allow a login to remain valid for
    three hours, thirty minutes and thirty seconds.
** `landing`
*** `enable` - Controls whether the Kabanero landing page is deployed by
    the Kabanero operator.  Valid values are `true` and `false`.  The default
    value is `true`.
** `che`
*** `enable` - Controls whether Kabanero will deploy an instance of Che.
    Valid values are `true` and `false`.  The default value is `false`.
*** `cheOperatorInstance`
**** `cheWorkspaceClusterRole` - The workspace cluster role used
     by Che.  By default, the `eclipse-codewind` cluster role is used.

The following `Status` fields are maintained by the Kabanero operator to
provide information about the installed components, and the health of the
Kabanero instance:

* `Status`
** `kabaneroInstance` - The overall status information of the
   Kabanero instance.
*** `ready` - The overall Status of Kabanero.  A value of `True`
    indicates Kabanero has been installed successfully.  A value of `False`
    indicates that there was a problem, and more information can be found
    by looking in the `errorMessage` attribute.
*** `errorMessage` - Provides more details for a `ready` status of `False`.
*** `version` - Shows the version of Kabanero that is currently installed.
    This version can be different from `Spec.version` if there is a problem
    configuring and installing the `Spec.version`.

== Inspecting your Kabanero CR Instance

You can retrieve all the Kabanero CR instances in a namespace using this
command:

`oc get Kabanero -n kabanero -o yaml`

The example uses the kabanero namespace.  To use a different namespace,
replace `-n kabanero` with the name of another namespace.

== Examples

The following yaml defines a `Kabanero` instance at version 0.2.0, using
the default collection set.

```yaml
apiVersion: kabanero.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kabanero
metadata:
  name: kabanero
  namespace: kabanero
spec:
  version: "0.2.0"
  collections:
    repositories:
    - name: central
      url: https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/v0.2.0-rc1/kabanero-index.yaml
      activateDefaultCollections: true
```

The following yaml defines a `Kabanero` instance at version 0.2.0, using
a custom collection set and its associated GitHub configuration.  Sessions
established using the Kabanero CLI remain valid for one hour.

```yaml
apiVersion: kabanero.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kabanero
metadata:
  name: kabanero
  namespace: kabanero
spec:
  version: "0.2.0"
  collections:
    repositories:
    - name: central
      url: https://github.com/my-organization/collections/releases/download/v0.1/kabanero-index.yaml
      activateDefaultCollections: true
  github:
    organization: my-organization
    teams:
      - collection-admins
      - admins
    apiUrl: https://api.github.com
  cli:
    sessionExpirationSeconds: 1h
```
